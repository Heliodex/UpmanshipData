# UpmanshipData

A 30,000 comment long thread downloaded from Reddit, at r/oneupmanship.

## programs

The `/programs` directory contains the programs used to generate statistics from the thread files (`./{x}k.tsv`, `./raw{x}k.tsv`). Expect bugs, bad code, and O(nÂ²) algorithms.

Run `__runner.py` to run all programs, and edit it to modify where the data is outputted (by default `./data`). Data is outputted mostly in markdown tables, for ease of distribution.
